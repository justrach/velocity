# VelocityDart

Welcome to VelocityDart, a local terminal emulator built with Flutter and Dartive. This project is a demonstration of how Dartive can be used to create an interactive terminal application that runs locally. 

## Overview

VelocityDart is a terminal emulator application built using Flutter for the UI and Dartive for handling HTTP requests. This application is styled to look like a traditional terminal, with a text input field for commands and an output display area.

## Usage

To use VelocityDart, simply type your command into the input field and press enter. The command will be sent as an HTTP POST request to the local server, which will return a response that will be displayed in the output area.

## Running the Application

To run VelocityDart, you will need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.
4. Start the application with `flutter run`.
